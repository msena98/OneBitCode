                <p><b>►Halo Infinite</b> -- Xbox Boss Discusses High-Level Staff Departures</p>

                    <p>Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty has commented on the many changes to senior leaders on Halo
                        Infinite's development team, saying turnover is natural in a field like game development. He also
                        suggested that some of the developers who left the team might have had a vision for Halo Infinite
                        that ran counter to what others wanted.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Speaking to The New York Times, Booty discussed the departures of creative director Tim Longo and
                    executive producer Mary Olson, as well as former studio head for FPS, Chris Lee.</p>
                <p>"There's always going to be turnover of leaders--it's inevitable," Booty said. He added that sometimes
                    "the momentum of the project is going one way, and that person has a vision that's going the other way."
                </p>
                <p>Booty's comment is intriguing to think about, but it doesn't include any specifics about a different
                    direction for Halo Infinite that might have been considered during development. GameSpot has followed up
                    with Microsoft in an attempt to get more details.</p>
                <p>Microsoft veteran Joseph Staten stepped in to lead the Halo Infinite development team after Lee left.
                    Following Lee's departure, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said he believes turnover in a creative field like
                    game development is actually a good thing. "I don't have any specific concern about 343. I actually
                    think in the long run, turnover is a healthy thing because we want people who are really motivated by
                    the things that they're working on," Spencer said.</p>

                <p><b>►Battlefield 2042</b> -- May Have Even More Fixes On The Way</p>

                    <p>While Battlefield 2042 returns the franchise to its Battlefield 3 heyday with a modern setting and modern
                        weapons, the game has also fallen victim to a number of bugs and technical issues. Thankfully, players
                        won't have to deal with at least a few of those problems for much longer, as DICE is reportedly looking
                        into them.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>A post from the fan-run Twitter account Battlefield Bulletin claims that DICE is currently tackling four
                    issues that Battlefield 2042 players have reported. Those issues range from players rubber banding when
                    they get hit by rockets from a jet or helicopter and missile relock not working to options for changing
                    the transparency and size of various icons.</p>
                <p>However, the post doesn't detail when players can expect these issues to be fixed. Similarly, the
                    Battlefield Direct Communication account, which is run by Battlefield developers and regularly posts
                    when updates are coming out and what their contents will be, hasn't mentioned any of these issues yet.
                </p>
                <p>While Battlefield 2042 has had a rough launch, the game is slowly being fixed by developers DICE and
                    Ripple Effect. One upcoming patch for the game will address issues with players failing to be revived
                    and balancing problems with two of the game's vehicles as well as the UAV-1.</p>
                <p>For players, fixes for Battlefield 2042 are arriving far too late. The game has been panned on Steam,
                    where it has a "mostly negative" aggregate score. At the moment, 33,000 of the game's 44,000 reviews are
                    negative, with players citing bugs and a lack of features compared to past titles.</p>

                <p><b>►Overwatch 2</b> -- Beta Starts In April, PvE Being "Decoupled" From PvP</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <div class="img-side">
                    <img src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/overwatch-2-alpha-beta-announcement.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=960&h=500&dpr=1.5" alt="">
                    <p>As Overwatch players know, the state of the game hasn't been everything that the community has wanted. Overwatch 2's development has become Blizzard's priority, leading to little new content in the original game and little communication from Blizzard itself.</p>
                </div>
                <p>That's exactly what Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller acknowledges and apologizes for in his latest developer update video. In turn, Keller also promises a change in direction that could get Overwatch 2 in players' hands sooner than expected. The idea is that Keller knows Blizzard hasn't lived up to Overwatch fan expectations so far and something needs to change. To start, Keller says that Blizzard will be much more communicative going forward. That's not the biggest promise that Keller makes, however.</p>
                <p> He says that the team has decided, since it can't shift back to Overwatch for more content at this point, to get Overwatch 2 playable as soon as it can instead. What that means is that Blizzard will be prioritizing the competitive side of Overwatch 2, the PvP half of the game, over its PvE plans since that's the heart of the gameplay experience evolving from the original game. Blizzard's work has also borne fruit.</p>
                <p>It plans to launch Overwatch 2's first PvP alpha test within the week. This alpha will be exclusively available to Blizzard employees and professional Overwatch players, a required first step before making it available more broadly. As for when Overwatch 2 will start being available to more players, Keller says that a closed PvP beta is tentatively planned for release in April. It's clearly an aggressive timeline, moving from an internal alpha to an external closed beta in just a month or two.</p>
                <p> But it's evidence of Keller's promise to get Overwatch 2 available as fast as possible. Keller says that the development team is confident in the quality of Overwatch 2 based on internal feedback and that he believes players will agree.</p>
